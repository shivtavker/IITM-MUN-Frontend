# IITMMUN

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/home`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

<!-- This is simple procedure you should follow for all projects
    Hosting wesite doesn't come in picutre for our case as we have our own server.. I will just do git pull in the server.. FOr Hosting website even you just need to give repo link.. They will automatically run it.. we need not worry!!
    I will try running this on server.. I will send you url when it goes live..
    And i didnt put the loader... is it fine? If possible put the loader
    Then just add these commands 
    git add ./
    git commit -m "Added Loader"
    git push origin master
    PLease don't make any mistake in above commands.. Since I have given you edit right for the repo you can delete everything by a small mistake!
    And also when the website first opens it does not show the homepage....
    Solve these issues..
    Tell Rasiak that some work is left and need to do.. Shiv has wired things up.. We can go live as soon as those things are taken care of
    So we can do it tomorrrow right YEah, Sure.. just do that first complete loader and run above commands.. Msg me when loader is done.. 
    I will check if commands are executed properly.. I will then tell you how write ur own commands..
    ok..
    COol Bye/..
    I will push the things when it will get done... :)
