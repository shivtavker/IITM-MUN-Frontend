                <p class="title">Gowtham Srinivas is an avid MUNner who has attended 60+ MUNs spanning all over India. He is a Political Science major and often comes across various topics that help keep him up to date on the current affairs of the world as well as agendas of MUNs. Gowtham particularly enjoys MUNs as it gives people a chance to constructively debate world problems and arrive at well-informed solutions. He also enjoys the sessions themselves, the small jokes, and the heated lobbying. His ideal MUN session includes no unnecessary interventions from delegates or the EB, smooth flow of debate, a strict following of procedure, and maintenance of decorum. He found his true calling as a MUNner during his 5th MUN when he realized the true competitive nature of MUNs. Since then, he has thrived to make himself the best MUNner he could be. Gowtham has played various roles in MUNs ranging from delegate to chairperson which gives him a well-rounded understanding of all the elements of a MUN. Being a predominantly Security Council and Crisis Committee delegate, he has also branched out into various other committees such as UNODC, SOCHUM, EU, ECOSOC, and GA to help him learn and grow as a MUNner.
