From primarily looking inward and engaging with domestic reforms, to gradually forging global partnerships, ORF plays a seminal role in building political and policy consensus that enables India to interact with the world. It carries Indian voices and ideas to forums shaping global debates. It provides non-partisan, independent, well-researched analyses and inputs to diverse decision-makers in governments, business communities, and academia and to civil society around the world.</p>

                        <p class="title">Fazil is an engineering graduate from Hindustan University, Chennai. As someone who has a profound interest in problem solving, international affairs and public speaking, MUNs will always hold a place close to his heart, irrespective of where he is in life. Fazil is a veteran of 2 and a half years in the MUN circuit with a specialization in Security Councils, crisis committees and character committees. Fazil believes that international affairs is an elaborate chess game, with every individual international relationship being a mini game in itself, with two colors: black and white, but each color controlled by multiple players rather than just one. Fazil loves debating about anything and everything on stage as well as in general conversation. You can catch him talking passionately against radical religious practices, championing for gender equality, dissecting the fall of the Soviet Union, pondering about the curious case of Donald Trump and analyzing the beauty of SARRIBALL.
