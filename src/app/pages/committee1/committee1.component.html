                      <p class="title" align="justify">Brahadeesh is an avid debater and MUNer and started out back in 2009. He is born and brought up in Chennai. Having chaired at conferences across the country, and even at Paris International MUN 2015, Brahadeesh's name is synonymous with DISEC across the chennai circuit. Brahadeesh is also well travelled and has interacted with diplomats, including those involved with the Iran nuclear deal from the French delegation. (Can't help it if the deal fell through).
                        He is, among other reasons, best known for his use of article 19 in his point of order on the executive board during roll call and the infamous arctic circle resolution as a delegate in SRMMUN 2016. 
                        With Braha at the helm, you can be sure to have an amazing time in his committee.

              <p class="title" align="justify">If you ever find a person with a face in his beard, rather that a beard on his face, you’ve probably met Krishnakumar Ramachandran.  Preferring to go by the name Krishna ( and not KK, as the popular myth goes), he has been doing DISECs since he can remember - for which he’ll tell you this long story about how he did his first MUN because his friends needed a translation in the Delhi circuit.  Having done about 30 MUNs, Krishna has been MUNing since 11th grade in school, and has almost exclusively done DISECs.  He’s been on the EB on 12 occasions now.  He is a stickler for discipline as part of the EB, but will ensure that you have an enriching learning experience, and a bit of fun, while at it.  He believes that a great delegate is not only one who researches, or one who has good people-skills, but one who can combine these traits with sharp analysis and a keen understanding of human behaviour.  When he does not MUN, Krishna devotes his time to research in Biotechnology, the unfortunate subject of his misplaced affection.  He also involves himself in photography, which was probably going to be his profession if not for Hitler Qureshi.  Overall, give him pizzas and memes, and he’ll be alright.

                      <p class="title">If you find a person in the vicinity of a  Domino's pizza every other day, then you've met Tejash Bagri. Stuck in the third year of EEE, he finds his solace in MUNs. He's smart, witty and everything in between. However, these words still fall short to describe this force to be reckoned with. He's the DebSoc Convener of SRM and also one of the Domain Heads of Council Affairs for SRMMUN 2019. He has been a part of over 25+ MUNs, serving as a delegate, EB member and a member of the OC. He is someone who values research that translates into strong impact in committee. Show him a "quality" meme that he hasn't come across, and the two of you could be the best of F.R.I.E.N.D.S.</p>
